# Lab Answer Key:  Module 2: Implementing and managing Azure networking
# Lab A: Using a deployment template, Azure PowerShell, and Azure CLI to implement Azure virtual networks
  
## Exercise 1: Creating an Azure virtual network by using a deployment template
  
#### Task 1: Review a GitHub Azure quickstart template

1. Ensure that you are signed in to MIA-CL1 as **Student** with the password **Pa55w.rd**. 

2. Start Microsoft Edge and browse to the **Virtual Network with two Subnets** Github-hosted Azure quickstart template at http://aka.ms/Mt32e4. 
  
3. In Microsoft Edge, on the **Virtual Network with two Subnets** page, click **Deploy to Azure**.

4. If prompted, sign in by using the Microsoft account that is the Service Administrator of your Azure subscription.

5. In the Azure portal, on the **Create a Virtual Network with two Subnets** blade, click **Edit template**.

6. Review the structure of the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file. Examine the placeholders for values that can be edited during the deployment. This template contains the following parameters: _vnetName_,  _vnetAddressPrefix_, _subnet1Prefix_, _subnet1Name_, _subnet2Prefix_, and _subnet2Name_.

7. Review the content of the **Resources** section to identify type of the resource, its name, and properties.

8. Click **Discard** to close the Edit Template blade.

> **Note:** If the template fails to load into the Azure portal, navigate to the following URL:
        [http://aka.ms/Fpqovq](http://aka.ms/Fpqovq) . Then, select and copy all text on the page. Paste the copied text into the **Edit template** blade, then perform steps 4 and 5 to review the template and close the Edit Template blade without making any changes.


#### Task 2: Perform the deployment from the Azure portal
  
1. On the **Create a Virtual Network with two Subnets** blade, specify the following settings and then click **Purchase**.

  - Subscription: select the name of your subscription in the drop down list

  - Resource group: ensure that **Create new** option is selected and type **20533D0203-LabRG** in the text box below

  - Location: in the drop-down list, select an Azure region close to the location of the lab environment

  - Vnet Name: **20533D0203-vnet**

  - Vnet Address Prefix: **10.10.0.0/16**

  - Subnet1Prefix: **10.10.0.0/24**

  - Subnet1Name: **Subnet1**

  - Subnet2Prefix: **10.10.1.0/24**

  - Subnet2Name: **Subnet2**

  - I agree to the terms and conditions stated above: enabled

2. Verify that provisioning of the new virtual network with name **20533D0203-vnet** completed successfully.


> **Result**: After completing this exercise, you should have created virtual networks by using an Azure Resource Manager deployment template


## Exercise 2: Creating a virtual network by using PowerShell
  
#### Task 1: Create a virtual network by using PowerShell
  
1. On MIA-CL1, right-click the Windows PowerShell icon and then click **Run ISE as Administrator**. When prompted by User Account Control for confirmation, click **Yes**.

2. In the Windows PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE), in the console pane, type the following cmdlet and then press Enter:
  ```
  Add-AzureRmAccount
  ```

3. In the sign-in windows that appears, sign in by using the Microsoft account that is the Service Administrator of your Azure subscription.

4. If you have multiple subscriptions associated with your Microsoft account, to identify the subscription in which you are going to create a virtual network, type the following command, and then press Enter
  ```
  Get-AzureRmSubscription
  ```

5. Note the value of the `Id` property for each subscription in the output of the previous command. To specify the subscription in which you are going to create a virtual network, type the following commands, and then press Enter (replace `SubscriptionId` with the actual SubscriptionId property of that subscription):
  ```
  Set-AzureRmContext -Subscription 'SubscriptionId'
  ```

6. To create a new resource group, type the following command, and then press Enter (replace `AzureRegion` with the name of the same Azure region you chose in the previous exercise):
  ```
  $rg = New-AzureRMResourceGroup -Name '20533D0204-LabRG' -Location 'AzureRegion'
  ```

7. To create a new virtual network named **20533D0204-vnet** with the address space **10.11.0.0/16** and store a reference to it in the `$vnet` variable, type the following command, and then press Enter:
  ```
  $vnet = New-AzureRmVirtualNetwork -ResourceGroupName $rg.ResourceGroupName -Name '20533D0204-vnet' -AddressPrefix '10.11.0.0/16' -Location $rg.Location
  ```

8. To add a subnet to the new virtual network, type the following command, and then press Enter: 
  ```
  Add-AzureRmVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name 'Subnet1' -VirtualNetwork $vnet -AddressPrefix '10.11.0.0/24'
  ```

9. To update the configuration in the virtual network, type the following command, and then press Enter:
  ```
  Set-AzureRmVirtualNetwork -VirtualNetwork $vnet
  ```

> **Result**: After completing this exercise, you should have created a virtual network by using Azure PowerShell. 


## Exercise 3: Creating a virtual network by using Azure CLI

4. On the **Device Login** page, type the code included in the message. This will identify Microsoft Azure Cross-platform Command Line Interface as the application publisher. Click **Continue**. 

5. In the sign-in windows that appears, sign in by using the Microsoft account that is the Service Administrator of your Azure subscription.

6. Note the message stating that you have signed in to the Microsoft Azure Cross-platform Command Line Interface application on your device. Close the Microsoft Edge window.

7. If you have multiple subscriptions associated with your Microsoft account, to identify the subscription in which you are going to create a virtual network, type the following command, and then press Enter
  ```
  az account show
  ```

8. Note the value of the '_id_' property for each subscription in the output of the previous command. To specify the subscription in which you are going to create a virtual network, type the following commands, and then press Enter (replace `SubscriptionId` with the actual SubscriptionId property of that subscription):
  ```
  az account set --subscription "SubscriptionId"
  ```

9. To create a new resource group, type the following command, and then press Enter (replace `AzureRegion` with the name of the same Azure region you chose in the previous exercise):
  ```
  az group create --name 20533D0205-LabRG --location "AzureRegion"
  ```

10. To create a new virtual network named **20533D0205-vnet** with the address space **10.12.0.0/16** and a subnet named Subnet1 with the address prefix of 10.12.0.0/24, type the following command, and then press Enter (replace `AzureRegion` with the name of the same Azure region you chose in the previous exercise):
  ```
  az network vnet create --name 20533D0205-vnet --resource-group 20533D0205-LabRG --location "AzureRegion" --address-prefix 10.12.0.0/16 --subnet-name Subnet1 --subnet-prefix 10.12.0.0/24
  ```

11. To add a subnet to the new virtual network, type the following command, and then press Enter: 
  ```
  az network vnet subnet create --address-prefix 10.12.1.0/24 --name Subnet2 --resource-group 20533D0205-LabRG --vnet-name 20533D0205-vnet
